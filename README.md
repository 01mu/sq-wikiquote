# sq-wikiquote
Get authors and quotes from wikiquote.org. Since user-edited Wikiquote pages are not formatted consistently some quotes are not included. There are over 100,000 quotes from over 7,000 authors.
## Usage
Get quotes from an individual author:
```php
<?php
include_once 'sq-wikiquote.php';

$wikiquote = new wikiquote();

$quotes = $wikiquote->get_author_quotes('Richard Stallman');

for($i = 0; $i < count($quotes); $i++)
{
    print($quotes[$i] . "\n\n");
}
```
```

GNU, which stands for Gnu's Not Unix, is the name for the complete Unix-compatible software system which I am writing so that I can give it away free to everyone who can use it.

Hundreds of thousands of babies are born every day. While the whole phenomenon is menacing, one of them by itself is not newsworthy. Nor is it a difficult achievement â€” even some fish can do it. (Now, if you were a seahorse, it would be more interesting, since it would be the male that gave birth.) ...These birth announcements also spread the myth that having a baby is something to be proud of, which fuels natalist pressure, which leads to pollution, extinction of wildlife, poverty, and ultimately mass starvation.

Get names by page "List_of_people_by_name,_C", etc.:
```php
<?php
include_once 'sq-wikiquote.php';

$wikiquote = new wikiquote();

$pages = $wikiquote->get_pages();
$c_names = $wikiquote->get_authors($pages[2]); // List_of_people_by_name,_C

for($i = 0; $i < count($c_names); $i++)
{
    print($c_names[$i] . "\n\n");
}
```
